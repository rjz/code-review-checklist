Code Review Checklist
===========================================

> A hardly exhaustive collection of considerations when peer-reviewing software.

- - -

Clean, merge-ready pull requests:

##### Functionality

  - [ ] implement relevant specification(s)
  - [ ] anticipate and address failure modes
  - [ ] avoid (or adequately justifies) obvious performance issues
  - [ ] provide appropriate user feedback
  - [ ] expose logs, errors, and other runtime debugging details as needed

##### Testing

  - [ ] secure behaviors described in relevant specification(s)
  - [ ] test public interfaces
  - [ ] cover anticipated failure modes
  - [ ] benchmark recognized performance issues
  - [ ] run green

##### Legibility

  - [ ] embrace style and patterns established by the project, team, and
      community
  - [ ] consume existing libraries, methods, and types
  - [ ] use suggestive names for functions, variables, and classes
  - [ ] document public interfaces as appropriate
  - [ ] remove (or adequately support) TODOs, legacy code, and hacks

##### Security

  - [ ] bound and sanitize inputs
  - [ ] sanitize outputs, including analytics and [logs][sanitize-logs]
  - [ ] recognize and address common vulnerabilities ([SQL
      injection][sql-injection], [XSS][xss], [buffer overruns][buffer-overflow],
      etc)
  - [ ] isolate platform-/environment-specific functionality

##### Dependency Management
  - [ ] avoids (or adequately justifies) the addition of 3rd-party code
  - [ ] ensures the license is appropriate for inclusion
  - [ ] the functionality is truly better-off as a dependency instead of a 1st-party implementation
  - [ ] the 3rd-party code does not conflict with 1st-party standards
  - [ ] the 3rd-party code is actively maintained

##### VCS Hygiene

  - [ ] provide [clear, useful commit messages][git-commit]
  - [ ] [reference external issues, tickets, and bugs][supplemental-docs] where
      they exist
  - [ ] use incremental, atomic commits
  - [ ] avoid binaries, logs, local configurations, environment-specific files,
      plaintext secrets, or other unwanted artifacts
